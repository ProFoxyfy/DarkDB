# DarkDB Installer
You are viewing the branch for the DarkDB Installer.
The installation is interactive, so no explanation is needed.

Except... Wait...

# Tutorial

## Step 1: Language
Just type in the number that corresponds to the language and you're good to go!

## Step 2: Branch
Similar to the language step, but you pick a branch of DarkDB.

## Step 3: Folder
A Tkinter window will pop up telling you to select a folder. Pick the folder your source code is contained in, and done!

## Step 4: Finish!
If there is any exception, try the installer again.
If that still doesn't work feel free to create an Issue.
I will try to answer it as soon as i can!
